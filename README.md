# Twitter to SSB Import 

Script to import tweets from Twitter to ssb, so that they will display in Patchwork.

You must request your Twitter archive and place the tweet data folder in this directory. 

In `config.js` need to set screen_name to your Twitter handle, and whether retweets will be included.

**Warning:** This is a preliminary implementation. Many things left to do to make it actually useful. 

## Todo: 

- Ability to preview before adding to ssb
- CLI usage
